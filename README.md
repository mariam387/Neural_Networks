# AI-Based Decision Systems

This repository contains two machine learning projects:

1. **Cyber Threat Detection** – Identifying malicious activity from system logs  
2. **Credit Card Approval Prediction** – Predicting approval of credit card applications  

Each project leverages AI models to support critical real-world decisions in security and finance.

## Project 2: Credit Card Approval Prediction

### Description
A machine learning model that predicts whether a customer’s credit card application will be approved, based on various financial and personal attributes. The goal is to automate approval decisions and reduce risk for financial institutions.

### Techniques Used
- Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
- Feedforward Neural Networks (FFNs)
- Logistic Regression
- Data Preprocessing (Label Encoding, Normalization)
- Feature Engineering & Selection
- Model Evaluation (Confusion Matrix, Accuracy Score)
- Interactive Interface with Streamlit

### Tools & Technologies
- Python, Scikit-learn  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Streamlit
